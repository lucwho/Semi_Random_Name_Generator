# Semi_Random_Name_Generator

Hello everyone, this script picks random Names from a given list. 
If the Name is picked, it will be put on a "blacklist" so it won't be used again.
The same can be used for combined Names (Surname and Familiy Name).

## How to use:

Simply download the script, place it in a folder and run it for the first time. After that, the script will create all necessary files in the folder.
  
If you have done that, go to File -> Edit Lists and fill in your First- and Surnames. Click on Save and then on cancel. If you getasked to generate the possibleFUll.txt click on yes. After that you can click on the Buttons in the Main Menu and get your Names. 
Have fun!
