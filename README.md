# Semi_Random_Name_Generator

Hello everyone, this script picks random Names from a given list. 
If the Name is picked, it will be put on a "blacklist" so it won't be used again.
The same can be used for combined Names (Surname and Familiy Name).

## How to use:

simply download the script, place it in a folder and run it for the first time. After that, the script will create all necessary files in the folder.
  
If you have done that, go to File -> Edit Lists and fill in your First- and Surnames. After that you can click on the Buttons and get your Names. 
Have fun!
