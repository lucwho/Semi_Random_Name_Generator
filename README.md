# Semi_Random_Name_Generator

Hello everyone, this little script picks random Names from a given list. 
If the Name is picked, it will be put on a blacklist so it won't be used again.
The same can be used for combined Names (Surname and Familiy Name).

## How to use:

simply download the script, place it in a folder and create following .txt files
  - Surname.txt
  - possibleFull.txt
  - used.txt
  - usedFull.txt
  - Firstname.txt
  
If you have done that, fill Names in the files firstname and Surname. After that you can run the code and get your Names. 
Have fun!
